Grey-box Cybercafe is a user-friendly interface designed to streamline cybercafe management with tailored functionalities for Owners, Admins, and Regular Users. Owners have full control over configurations, admin permissions, bandwidth management, and content updates, while Admins manage users, payments, and restrictions based on owner-defined access. Regular Users enjoy a simple portal to monitor usage, access help, and interact with blogs for updates and support. The project emphasizes responsive layouts, intuitive design, and scalable architecture, making it accessible for users with minimal technical expertise. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, it aims to provide an efficient, adaptable, and easy-to-use platform for cybercafe operations.
